* Project: Distributed Social Networking
** Description
   
   The web is fundamentally interconnected and peer to peer. There's
   no really great reason why we should all use facebook.com or
   google+ or myspace or something like that. If these social networks
   came up with an API you could probably link between them and use
   the social network you wanted. Furthermore you might gain some
   autonomy.

   Thus in the spirit of diaspora https://diasporafoundation.org/ we
   want to build something like diaspora but far far simpler.

   This blogging/social network platform will allow the importing of
   other sources of posts (github, twitter, etc.) as well allow the
   distributing sharing of posts and content.

   An author sitting on one server can aggregate the posts of their
   friends on other servers.   

   We are going to go with an inbox model where by you share posts to
   your friends by sending them your posts. This is similar to
   activity pub: https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/ Activity Pub is
   great, but too complex for a class project.
   
   We also won't be adding much in the way of encryption or security
   to this platform. We're keeping it simple and restful.

   Choose at least 2 other groups to work with

*** Scenario 

   I log into SocialDistribution. I see my stream which is filled with
   posts that have arrived in my inbox. I browse them and I click like
   on anything by friend Steph who is on another node.

   When I click like, my node sends a like object to Steph's inbox
   that references her post.

   I then comment on Steph's post. This sends a comment object to
   Steph's inbox that references her post.

   Steph's node will process events at her inbox and record the
   comments and likes appropriately.

   Then I write a public post, a public service announcement (PSA)
   about how public service announcements are pretentious performative
   social media and you shouldn't make them. The irony is lost on me.
   I make an unlisted image post that contains an image for the PSA
   and reference it from my PSA post. Nonetheless my node records my
   post and makes a URL for both posts and then proceeds to send my
   public posts to the inboxes of everyone who follows me. My node
   knows who follows me and thus can just send the public post to each
   of those inboxes. Perhaps there will be a scaling problem in the
   future.

   Later I write a message to Steph, a post that is private to just her.
   This post is sent to her inbox.

   When Steph logs into her node she'll see her stream and my public
   post will be on her stream. She should also see that I've liked and
   commented her post.

*** Scenario Summary

    All actions from authors are routed through the inbox of the
    receiving authors by the node itself.

    Nodes will store copies of posts because they receive them in the
    inbox.

    Likes, Comments, Public Posts, Friends Only posts, Private posts are
    all sent to the inbox of the author.

*** Project Parts 
    - Part 0 - sign up a repo
    - Part 1 - 1/2 way implementation
    - Part 2 - Connect with Groups
    - Part 3 - Finish it off!

** Collaboration
   - You may consult with others but the submission should be your
     own team's source code.
   - You may work with 5 other students (groups of 5)
   - Work will be submitted together
   - Collaboration must be documented in the README.md file
   - Any external source code must be referenced and documented in
     the README.md file
   - You make collaborate/consult with other groups in order to get
     your webservices to integrate with each other

** Main Concepts
   - Author
     - makes posts
     - makes friends
     - befriends other authors
     - likes posts
     - comments on posts
     - a generally nice person
   - Server Admin
     - manages a node
     - allows people to sign up
     - responsible for private data :(
   - Follow
     - Friend another author and they accept the friend request
     - They will send their posts to your inbox
   - Friend
     - Someone who follows you.
   - True Friend
     - Bidirectional friendship.
   - Real Friend
     - True friend
   - Server
     - a host that hosts authors and vouches for them
   - Restful service
     - The model of the service and its API
   - UI
     - The HTML/CSS/JS coated version user interface 
   - Public Post
     - this is a post that will show up publicly. 
     - it has a public URL
     - anyone can see it
     - Public posts can be liked
     - public posts can have comments from friends
   - Friend Post
     - this is a post that is shared to friends (followers)
     - since it is sent, it is a message and not changeable
     - Friend posts can be liked
     - Friend posts can have comments sent back to the author via the author's inbox
   - Inbox
     - This is what a READER or USER of the social network has. They make friends, and friends send objects to their inbox.
     - This forms the backbone of the timeline of the social media user.
     - This receives likes and comments.
   - Remote
     - A node to node connection. Requests from another node. HTTP Basic Auth authenticated.
   - Local
     - A local user accessing the REST API. Likely will use their cookie-auth, basic auth, or token auth. Local usually implies you check whether or not the user should have access. For instance local API access to the inbox should be limited to only that authenticated authors---don't snoop!

** Authentication
   - Remote node authentication is global between nodes. It requires an admin to allow node to node access.
   - Remote node authentication is done solely with HTTP basic auth
   - Local auth uses your frameworks local auth mechanisms (cookies, tokens, basic auth).   - Local refers to local access to the restful API. This is useful for frameworks like react, vue, or angular to get access to data, and enable a more client heavy UI.

** Pagination
   - If something is paginated it has query options:
     - page - how many pages of objects have been delivered
     - size - how big is a page
     - Page 4 of objects http://service/potsts/{post_id}/comments?page=4
     - Page 4 of objects but 40 per page http://service/posts/{post_id}/comments?page=4&size=40
     - 1 based indexing. First page is 1.
** Objects
   - HTTP Methods not explicitly listed are not allowed methods
   - Most HTTP methods are local only, and provided for local node use.
*** Authors
    - URL: ://service/authors/
      - GET [local, remote]: retrieve all profiles on the server (paginated)

    - Example query: GET ://service/authors?page=10&size=5 
      - Gets the 5 authors, authors 45 to 49.
    - Example: GET ://service/authors/

*** Image Posts
    Image Posts are just posts that are images. But they are encoded as base64 data.
    You can inline an image post using a data url or you can use this 
    shortcut to get the image if authenticated to see it.
    - URL: ://service/authors/{AUTHOR_ID}/posts/{POST_ID}/image
      - GET [local, remote] get the public post converted to binary as an iamge
        - return 404 if not an image
    - This end point decodes image posts as images. This allows the use of
      image tags in markdown.
    - You can use this to proxy or cache images.

*** Comments
    - URL: ://service/authors/{AUTHOR_ID}/posts/{POST_ID}/comments
      - GET [local, remote] get the list of comments of the post whose id is POST_ID (paginated)
      - POST [local] if you post an object of "type":"comment", it will add your comment to the post whose id is POST_ID
    - example comment from ://service/authors/{AUTHOR_ID}/posts/{POST_ID}/comments
