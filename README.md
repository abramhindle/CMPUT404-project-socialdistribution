- [Remote - Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker)
- [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)

## Setup
1. Make a copy of `.env.TEMPLATE` as `.env`
2. Make sure Docker is running
3. In VSCode, press the green icon in the bottom left of your window and select `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` in the dropdown
